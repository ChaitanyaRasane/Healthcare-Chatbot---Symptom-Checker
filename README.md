## Project Structure

Here’s how the project is organized:

```
Healthcare-Chatbot---Symptom-Checker/
│
├── Data/
│   └── …                # Symptom / disease datasets
├── MasterData/  
│   └── …                # Larger reference data if needed
├── app.py               # Entry point of the application
├── chat_bot.py          # Core logic of chatbot conversations
├── model.py             # Disease prediction / symptom‐matching model
├── utils.py             # Utility/helper functions
├── requirements.txt     # Python packages required
├── .gitignore
└── Chaitu.md            # Miscellaneous / Notes
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user enters their symptoms (free text or from a list).  
2. **Processing**: The system uses a symptom‐disease matching model (or decision logic) to find conditions that match.  
3. **Output**: The chatbot suggests possible diseases and shows precautionary measures.  
4. **Additional**: Utility functions help cleaning input, matching symptoms, ranking possible conditions, etc.

## Future Improvements

- Add more robust natural language understanding for symptom input.  
- Include severity prediction.  
- Integrate with external medical databases or APIs.  
- Add voice input / speech interface.  
- Add multilingual support.
